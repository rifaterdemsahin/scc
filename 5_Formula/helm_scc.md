prompt: what to setup an elastic search on openshift where there are scc setup already made how can i use the helm chart from bitnami and assign the correct service account to have a succesful deployment

Setting up Elasticsearch on OpenShift using Bitnami’s Helm chart involves several steps, particularly if security context constraints (SCCs) are already configured. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Helm Installed**: Ensure Helm is installed and configured for your cluster.
2. **OpenShift CLI (oc)**: You should have access to the OpenShift CLI and necessary permissions.
3. **Service Account with SCC**: Ensure the service account is pre-configured with the required SCC.

### Steps to Deploy Elasticsearch:

#### 1. **Add Bitnami Helm Repository**
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
```

#### 2. **Create or Assign a Service Account**
Create or use an existing service account with the required SCC. For example:
```bash
oc create serviceaccount elasticsearch-sa
```

Assign the appropriate SCC (e.g., `anyuid` or a custom SCC) to this service account:
```bash
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z elasticsearch-sa -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<namespace>` with your target namespace.

#### 3. **Modify Helm Chart Values**
When using Bitnami’s Helm chart, you need to specify the custom service account and other OpenShift-specific configurations.

1. Download the default `values.yaml` file from the chart repository:
   ```bash
   helm show values bitnami/elasticsearch > values.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the `values.yaml` file to include:
   ```yaml
   global:
     serviceAccount:
       create: false
       name: elasticsearch-sa  # Replace with your service account name
   securityContext:
     enabled: true
     fsGroup: 1000  # Adjust based on your SCC
   podSecurityContext:
     enabled: true
     fsGroup: 1000  # Adjust based on your SCC
   elasticsearch:
     securityContext:
       runAsUser: 1000  # Adjust based on your SCC
   ```

#### 4. **Deploy Elasticsearch Using Helm**
Run the Helm installation command:
```bash
helm install elasticsearch bitnami/elasticsearch -f values.yaml --namespace <namespace>
```

#### 5. **Verify Deployment**
Check if the pods are running:
```bash
oc get pods -n <namespace>
```

If the pods fail, inspect the logs:
```bash
oc logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

#### 6. **Adjust SCC or Values if Needed**
- If there are permission issues, ensure the SCC assigned to your service account allows the required capabilities and access.
- Double-check `securityContext` and `podSecurityContext` values to align with your SCC.

#### 7. **Test the Elasticsearch Setup**
Once deployed successfully, access Elasticsearch to verify:
```bash
oc port-forward svc/elasticsearch 9200:9200 -n <namespace>
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9200`.

This setup ensures Elasticsearch runs within the security constraints of OpenShift while leveraging Bitnami’s Helm chart.
