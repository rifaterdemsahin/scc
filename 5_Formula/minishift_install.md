The error occurs because the `dnf` package manager is not available in your current environment. This usually happens if you're working in a system that doesn't use `dnf` (e.g., Ubuntu, which uses `apt`) or if `dnf` is not installed.

Here’s how you can resolve it:

---

### **1. Check Your Linux Distribution**
- Run:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/os-release
  ```
- Look for the `ID` or `NAME` field to confirm your distribution.  

If you're on a Fedora-based system, `dnf` should be installed. If not, proceed to install it.

---

### **2. Install `dnf` on Your System (If Necessary)**

#### **For Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems**  
You can install `dnf` by running:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dnf
```

#### **For Other Distributions**  
Refer to your distribution's documentation to install `dnf`.

---

### **3. If `dnf` Is Not Suitable for Your System**
- Replace `dnf` with the package manager native to your system:
  - **Ubuntu/Debian:** Use `apt`
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y origin-clients
    ```
  - **RHEL/CentOS (older versions):** Use `yum`
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y origin-clients
    ```

---

### **4. Alternative: Use a Containerized Environment**
If your system doesn’t support the required package manager or the tool you want, consider using a container:
1. Install Docker or Podman.
2. Pull a container image with the necessary environment:
   ```bash
   docker pull quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
   ```
   @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/scc (main) $ docker pull quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
latest: Pulling from openshift/origin-cli

3e9004538d30: Pull complete

3. Run the CLI from the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
   ```
